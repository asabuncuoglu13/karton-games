# Kart-ON Games

[```Read our research paper presented at Fablearn 2022 Conference```](./fablearn_paper.pdf)

**Kart-ON** uses card-based programming blocks to code sketches and animations easily. Kart-ON games uses a similar 
approach to play games to develop algorithmic thinking skills:

1. Create tangible representations of pre-defined game functions.
2. Use Teachable Machine to create a classifier model for these tangible representations.
3. Embed your Teachable Machine model link to our game interface.
4. Show your tangible function representations to develop the game.


Use this starter slide: [Google Slides - Intro Programming](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRJZMeVgRwhr5o0sq701NDOYR0IAgvkiZA1G3OtxemZ9sBFiog-NV3pHtKMDX6uldWccowsghHRu2Lf/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000)

Then follow this Codelab to use our game interface: [Flappy Bird - Teachable Machine Codelab](https://asabuncuoglu13.github.io/karton-games/tm/codelab/en/index.html#0)
